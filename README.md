AndroidSlides
=============

There is a problem when you are trying to find the relevant Android Security related presentations in general:
* The interesting articles are usually scattered across the internet.
* often they disappear when the owner forgets to renew their domain or shuts down their blog

This repository aims to solve this problem.

This repository aims to be an archive of all the Android presentations/whitepapers presented in conferences and references the conferences it was presented.
