AndroidSlides
=============

There is a problem when you are trying to find the relevant Android Security related presentations in general:
* The interesting articles are usually scattered across the internet.
* often they disappear when the owner forgets to renew their domain or shuts down their blog

Although, i have helped to document it in DroidSec. https://github.com/droidsec/droidsec.github.io/wiki/Android-Whitepapers
But some of the links are now no longer available.
This repository aims to solve this problem.

This repository aims to be an archive of all the Android presentations/whitepapers presented in conferences and references the conferences it was presented.
